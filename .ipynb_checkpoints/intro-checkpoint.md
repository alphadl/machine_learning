# Introduction
This book is about machine learning algorithms. It follows strictly to the content of the textbook: "Machine Learning: A probabilistic perspective" by Kevin P. Murphy

The aim of this book is to summarize the main points of each chapter and to provide [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) implementation of most algorithms provided in that book (hopefully all of them). So it both theoretical and practical purposes. So it would be better to read each chapter in that book first and refer to this book as a summarization and implementation.

**Note**
+ You can refer the TOC on the left hand side to navigate across the book.
+ All the images and equations I will extract directly from the textbook (I will refer figure number directly). All the images' credit goes to the author.
